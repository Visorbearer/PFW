Variable_name,Data_level,Data_Entry,Data_Type,Definition,Description
LOC_ID,site,assigned,categorical,Unique identifier for each survey site,Each observation location should have only one LOC_ID. A single observer may maintain more than one LOC_ID. This is the same field as LOC_ID in the site description dataset and can be used to link the observation data to the site description data in conjunction with PROJ_PERIOD_ID.
LATITUDE,site,participant,continuous,Latitude in decimal degrees for each survey site,Accuracy varies. See ENTRY_TECHNIQUE below. 
LONGITUDE,site,participant,continuous,Longitude in decimal degrees for each survey site,Accuracy varies. See ENTRY_TECHNIQUE below. 
SUBNATIONAL1_CODE,site,assigned,categorical,Country abbreviation and State or Province abbreviation of each survey site,"Format XX-XX where the left two letters indicate the country and the right two letters indicate the state or province code. E.g., CA-ON = Canada - Ontario"
ENTRY_TECHNIQUE,site,assigned,categorical,Variable indicating method of site localization,"Codes represent dozens of methods for site creation with varying degrees of specificity. These methods continue to evolve as online mapping technologies change. The most accurate locations have higher ""zoom level"" values (e.g., Google Map Zoom level 9). Note that postal code locations were geolocated at the centroid of the postal code within which the site is located (i.e., these sites lack accuracy and are not useful if you are trying to link to site to satellite-derived land cover data, for instance)."
SUB_ID,checklist,assigned,categorical,Unique identifier for each checklist,
OBS_ID,observation,assigned,categorical,Unique identifier for each observation of a species,One SUB_ID will have as many OBS_ID values as there were species reported on a given checklist.

PROJ_PERIOD_ID,season,assigned,categorical,Calendar year of end of FeederWatch season,"In the format 'PFW_2019' where PFW = Project FeederWatch. The year indicates the FeederWatch season which is defined as the year the season ended. E.g., the November 2018 through April 2019 season is labeled 'PFW_2019'. This is the same field as PROJ_PERIOD_ID in the site description dataset and can be used to link the observation data to the site description data in conjunction with LOC_ID."
SPECIES_CODE,observation,participant,categorical,"Bird species observed, stored as 6-letter species codes","Species codes are based on the eBird taxonomy. See ""Species Codes"" tab below for code translations. "
alt_full_spp_code,observation,participant,categorical,"Alternate code for bird species observed, lumping subspecies/recognizable forms","This column enables someone to ""roll up"" information on subspecies and recognizable forms into the species code of the full species instead of the code for the recognizable form. The species code values for the subspecies/forms are still the primary information stored in the column SPECIES_CODE, but the alternate code for the full species is available in the column immediately to its right."

VALID,observation,assigned,binary,Validity of each observation based on flagging system,"1 = observation did not trigger the automated review system or was reviewed and approved. 0 = observation triggered the automated review system and has either not been reviewed or was reviewed and left as 'invalid'. Use 0 records with extreme caution. Details of the review process: Bonter, D.N. and C.B. Cooper. 2012. Data validation in citizen science: A case study from Project FeederWatch. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 10:305-307."
REVIEWED,observation,assigned,binary,Review state of each observation based on flagging system,"1 = observation was reviewed by FeederWatch staff. 0 = observation either did not trigger the automated review system or has not yet been reviewed. Details of the review process: Bonter, D.N. and C.B. Cooper. 2012. Data validation in citizen science: A case study from Project FeederWatch. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 10:305-307."
PLUS_CODE,observation,assigned,binary,Variable indicating if the total number of a species seen was larger than the value reported,"Data field used on historic paper data forms (no longer being populated). Due to space limitations of the paper forms, some large flock sizes could not be recorded accurately. In such a case, the ""PLUS_CODE"" field is coded as '1', indicating that the number of birds seen was larger than that reported in the ""HOW_MANY"" field. Observations where PLUS_CODE = 1 and HOW_MANY = 9, 90, 99, or 999 should be used with caution. "
DAY1_AM,checklist,participant,binary,Variable indicating if observer watched during morning of count Day 1,"0 = observer did not watch their feeders during the morning of Day 1; 1 = observer did watch their feeders during this time interval. We suggest adding the values in the DAY1_AM, DAY1_PM, DAY2_AM and DAY2_PM fields into an aggregated measure of effort indicating the number of half days of observation effort (range = 1-4). "
DAY1_PM,checklist,participant,binary,Variable indicating if observer watched during afternoon of count Day 1,See DAY1_AM
DAY2_AM,checklist,participant,binary,Variable indicating if observer watched during morning of count Day 2,See DAY1_AM
DAY2_PM,checklist,participant,binary,Variable indicating if observer watched during afternoon of count Day 2,See DAY1_AM
EFFORT_HRS_ATLEAST,checklist,participant,categorical,Participant estimate of survey time  for each checklist,A second measure of observation effort. Categorical: 0.001 = less than 1 hour of observation during the 2-day count period;   1.001 = 1 to 4 hours of observation; 4.001 = 4 to 8 hours of observation; 8.001 = greater than 8 hours of observation. 
SNOW_DEP_ATLEAST,checklist,participant,categorical,Participant estimate of minimum snow depth during a checklist,An estimate of snow depth. Categorical: . = null; 0 = none; 0.001 = less than 5 cm; 5.000 = 5 to 15 cm; 15.001 = greater than 15 cm
DATA_ENTRY_METHOD,checklist,assigned,categorical,"Data entry method for each checklist (e.g., web, mobile app or paper form)","As of 2020, the three modes of data entry for the dataset include paper data forms (field value indicates 'paper'), the FeederWatch website (field value indicates various versions of 'Web' entry), or the mobile phone app (field value indicates various versions of 'Mobile' entry). "
